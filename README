# postgreSQL Project to Javascript

### Packages needed
1. Express
2. PostgreSQL
3. Node.js

### Steps to Connect Postgre to Javascript Server

1. Install PostgreSQL: Download and install PostgreSQL on your computer. It's a database system that we'll use to store and manage data for our Node.js application.

2. Create a Database: Open a tool that allows you to interact with PostgreSQL (like a command-line tool or a graphical interface). Create a new database specifically for your application. This is where your data will be stored.

3. Install the pg-promise Package: In your Node.js project folder, use a command called npm install pg-promise to install a package called pg-promise. It helps us connect and work with PostgreSQL in our Node.js application.

4. Create a Configuration File: Create a new file called db.js (you can name it anything you want) in your project folder. This file will store information about how to connect to your PostgreSQL database.

5. Define Connection Details: In the db.js file, write down the details needed to connect to your PostgreSQL database. This includes things like the location (host), port number, database name, username, and password.

6. Establish a Connection: In the db.js file, use the connection details to establish a connection between your Node.js application and the PostgreSQL database. This step enables your application to talk to the database.

7. Export the Database Instance: In the db.js file, make the connection instance available to other parts of your application. This allows you to use the database connection wherever you need it.

8. Import and Use the Database Instance: In your main application file (e.g., index.js), import the database connection by including a line of code. This lets you interact with the PostgreSQL database in your application.

### Code Configuration Snippet
```
const connectionConfig = {
  host: 'localhost',
  port: 3000,
  database: 'your_database_name', //Name of the database
  user: 'your_username', //username from PGAdmin
  password: 'your_password' //password from PGAdmin
};

```
